<!-- 

    This HTML document is for the CIS 160 User Interface Design class.
    
    This is the start document.
    It is based loosely on an actual faculty web site at Olympic College, though
    it is fictitious and does not present real information, per se. 
    
    The code below is provided for your convenience and can be used to
    help you when you produce your working prototype. 
    
    By the time you get to the final draft, it will need to show everything about the
    site as you would expect it to be completed. There is help available
    for coding if you need it.

    Feel free to modify the code to make whatever page changes you wish.     
	You will not be graded on proper coding practices; however, following best practices,
	such as indenting nested elements is advised.
	
	Notice there is one external style sheet (styles.css). This is where most of the style changes will
	occur. Be sure to spend time with the HTML first so that you are familiar with the page
	structure and element names.
	
	=====================================================================================
	
					How to Read the HTML Page Structure:
	
	* The document "body" includes 3 main parts: header, section#content, and footer. 
		(Don't confuse header and head elements. The header is a child of (appears under) the body. The head is a sibling of (appears above) the body.)
	
    1) The header contains the nav and top-level logo, etc., and appears at the top of the page. 
	2) The footer is fairly straight-forward and appears at the bottom of the page. 
	3) The section#content is the main content area and is split in two with two main parts: aside and div#mainContent.
		a) The aside appears on the left and has two sections for contact info; 
		b) The div#mainContent appears on the rigfht and has five sub-sections (welcome, courses, mailing, links, certs). 
		
	=====================================================================================
	
					Instructions:

	You are not stuck with this particular page structure. It represents the original design. 
	Your own design/layout may look quite a bit different from this. Your wireframes should guide you.
	Refer to your wireframes to produce the page according to your designs. 
	Rework the code below as needed to present the content according to your wireframe design ideas.

					<p><a href="#">CIS Digital Advisor</a></br>
						This is where you will learn
						important information about course and program
						offerings in CIS. This is a faculty-supported site
						and the information contained on it is subject to
						change. Keep up to date with advising dates, and
						learn about the CIS program, including its faculty
						members.</p>
					
					<p><a href="#">To see Other CIS Faculty Pages</a></br>
						This is the official CIS program page. It is maintained
						by the college, and it shows details about the degree
						and certificates related to CIS. This information matches
						what you find in the college catalog. Some of the information
						may not be current, since the catalog is a printed document
						that changes just once per year. For the most up-to-date news
						on program offerings, visit the CIS Digital Advisor page.</p>

					<p><a href="#">To Work on your Educational Plan</a></br>
						Everyone needs an educational plan. This link takes you to the 
						colllege's online planning tool, where you can map out your degree or 
						certificate classes. Not all classes run every quarter, so it's good
						to create a plan that includes prerequisites, etc. That way, you can
						prepare for graduating on time.</p>
